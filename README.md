# aussie++

Programming language from down under, inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/oa8chw/australian_programming_language/) Reddit post.

## Key Features
* üá¶üá∫ Syntax entirely comprised of Australian lingo and slang
* ü™É Wield an Australian's greatest weapon: use boomerangs (angle-brackets) instead of curly braces
* **True aussie mode**, where u çop «ùp·¥âsdn characters become valid code

## Example
```
G'DAY MATE!

THE HARD YAKKA FOR fibonacci IS ( x ) <
    YA RECKON x <= 1 ? BAIL x;

	BAIL fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2);
>

GIMME fibonacci(30);
```


# Language Details
`aussie++` is a dynamically-typed and interpreted language. All keywords are case-insensitive,
meaning `CHEERS C***!` is equivalent to `cheers C***!`, but all caps is strongly recommended.

## General
Programs must start with `G'DAY MATE!` and end with `CHEERS C***!`. You can use `GIMME <something>` to print to console
```
G'DAY MATE!

// Prints "blimey mate!" to console
GIMME "blimey mate!";

CHEERS C***!
```

## Types / Variables
Declare booleans, numbers, strings and `nil/null` like so:
```go
// Booleans
I RECKON thisIsTrue = YEAH, NAH;
I RECKON thisIsFalse = NAH, YEAH;

// Numbers
I RECKON lol = 42069;
I RECKON tinyNum = 0.00001;
I RECKON negativeNum = -1;

// Strings
I RECKON goodStr = "fair dinkum mate!";

// Nil/Null
I RECKON emptiness = BUGGER ALL;
```

## Control flow
`aussie++` supports if statements and pattern matching:
```go
// If/else statemets
YA RECKON 1 == 2 ? <
	GIMME "fark we broke math!";
> WHATABOUT NAH, YEAH == YEAH, NAH <
	GIMME "strewth we broke boolean logic!";
> WHATABOUT <
	GIMME "the universe is okay";
>

// Pattern matching
YA RECKON randomBeer() is a <
	"Fosters" ~ GIMME "Flamin' hell!";
	"Coopers" ~ GIMME "You Beauty!";
	somethinElse ~ "Yeah, dunno that one: " + somethinElse;
>
```

## Loops
`aussie++` has for and while loops. With for loops the main thing to note is that the ranges are specified using interval notation (`[` or `]` is inclusive, and `(` or `)` is exclusive). You can mix and match. You can break out of a loop by saying `MATE FUCK THIS`:
```go
// From 0-100
I RECKON x IS A WALKABOUT FROM [0, 100] <
	GIMME x;
>

// From 0-99
I RECKON x IS A WALKABOUT FROM [0, 100) <
	GIMME x;
>

I RECKON x IS A WALKABOUT FROM [0, 999999] <
	YA RECKON x > 1000 ? MATE FUCK THIS;
>
```

While loops are similar to those you would find in other languages, except that the loop only executes if the condition is false.

```
// OI MATE, PAY ATTENTION! THIS LOOP STOPS WHEN I'VE WALKED OVER 3 KM!

I RECKON kmWalked = 0;
I RECKON I'LL HAVE A WALKABOUT UNTIL (kmWalked > 3) <
	GIMME "i walked 1 km!";
	kmWalked = kmWalked + 1;
>
GIMME "BLOODY OATH I'M TIRED!";
```

### Functions
Define functions like so, using `BAIL <somethin>` to return values:
```go
THE HARD YAKKA FOR greeting () IS <
	BAIL "G'day mate!";
>

GIMME gdayMate();
```

### Standard library / Built-ins
The language currently comes with two built-ins, `ChuckSomeDice(start, end)` and `HitTheSack(ms)`:

```go
IMPOHT ME FUNC ChuckSomeDice;
IMPOHT ME FUNC HitTheSack;

THE HARD YAKKA FOR goIntoAComa() is <
	// Return a random integer from 0-100
	I RECKON duration = ChuckSomeDice(0, 100);

	// Sleep for `duration` seconds
	HitTheSack(duration * 1000);
	
	GIMME "strewth! i went into a coma!";
>

goIntoAComa();
```
